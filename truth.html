    <h1>You tell them the truth.</h1>
       
        <p class= "text">Simply speaking the government isn't too concerned with aliens. You confidently inform them that the main goal of the cia is to "investigate" civil rights activists, and sell drugs to vulnerable communities, in order to fund coups in South America. They simply don't have enough time to focus on the aliens. They squint at you and tell you you've been brainwashed by the government. It seems you aren't too popular at this table despite being well. An alien.</p>
