    <h1>You claim you're a student. </h1>
        <p class="text">You look a little old for it but the human suit is kind of ambiguous in age. You're really short but, the looseness in certain places could be mistaken as wrinkles. You sit down and this teacher comes up and starts explaining to you this weird version of math where like half the concepts are missing. <br>Like you're surprised these people even know what numbers are. <br> You say that "math is really easy huh". The teacher informs you that you're wrong and some problems are impossible to solve. The teacher tells you there's something called the rieman hypothesis which you can get a million dollars if you can answer it correctly since it's supposedly unsolvable. The teacher writes it down and of course you go up to the board and effortly solve it. Apparently this is big news because the teacher immediately runs out the door crying about how they now made a million bucks. Whatever. All the kids are happy because without a teacher math class is canceled for the day and now everyone thinks you're cool.
