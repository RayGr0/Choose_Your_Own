    <h1>You tell some lies.</h1>
       
        <p class= "text">You tell them that half of the teachers are aliens and they all definitely believe you. Little do they know. You're the real alien. Mwahahahaha. At least you've diverted any possible suspicions. No one will know the truth about you any time soon which is good because your confident if people knew you were an alien your cool factor would go way down.</p>
