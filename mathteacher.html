    <h1> You claim you're a teacher</h1>
        <p class = "text"> You look a little young for it but the human suit is kind of ambiguous so those.The looseness in your human suit in certain places could be mistaken as wrinkles.
You start teaching math basics and the whole class looks confused. 
            <br>
They're all asking stupid questions like "what do odious numbers have to do with thermodynamics."
            <br>
And 
        <br>
"Sir or ma'am this is algebra 2 we don't know calculus or quantum physics. " 
            <br>
You question if your translator is even working correctly. 
            <br>
Also 3 of the girls asked to go to the bathroom all around the same time and you know their bladders can't be linked so they probably just want to go outside and talk about how lame you are 
             <br> 
            >:(
             <br>
            high school girls are just really mean.
You don't get paid enough for this. Time for a new class.
