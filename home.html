        <p class="text">Today was a special day, and lots of human culture was learned. Earth might not be the safest place. Buuuut you made a lot of steps to make friends and all the experiences were valuable. Hopefully tomorrow you will be more popular with humans so you can live here.<br>
:) <br>
Plus if the day didnâ€™t go too well you can always use the time travel watch and redo it. c;
