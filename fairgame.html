        <p class= "text">You start playing and realize you have no clue what you're doing. You attempt to follow the rules and win by sheer of your own brainpower. Wait you're confused. You can't move your pieces anywhere on the board! Who would make this game!? It seems you underestimated either your brainpower or how confusing this game would be. Frick. You have lost terribly and the kids look confused at why you even offered this challenge. Oh well T-T</p>
