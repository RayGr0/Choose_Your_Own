        <p class= "text">You tell the kids it's alright because they seem kind of cool so once thi planet goes down they can ride intp the spaceship to the next habitable planet. They seem a bit confused and inform you you aren't an alien or cool. Is this bullying? :( you feel kind of bad but you really did mean what you say. you hope the earth will change for the better but from a realistic standpoint it's not happening soo enough.</p>
