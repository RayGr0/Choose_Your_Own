        <p class= "text"> You sit down and the teacher starts talking. 
The teacher informs you of global warming. Another climate disaster is happening already!!! This is very scary information to you so you start crying. The teacher tells you if you don't quiet down that you're going to have to leave the class. and all the other kids think you're a crybaby now. :(
