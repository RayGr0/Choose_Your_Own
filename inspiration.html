        <p>My inspiration was that I thought it would be cute and easy to do something where you are an alien going to human school. I wanted to pick something that I could think of scenarios  easily and there are lots of things that can happen if you're an alien in a school for humans. The alien I wrote is very simple minded and mainly cares about being cool and having friends, instead of things like world domination. The alien has all this advanced tech and mathematical knowledge but is very harmless and well meaning. I thought that it would be nice if I wrote the alien like a young kid who is trying to fit in, in a new environment. Scenarios flow kind of easy when you have a character that is sort of clueless in some ways but smart in other ways. One of my friends informed me that my plot was very similar to the cartoon show Invader Zim. I think my idea was still fairly original since there is a very different theme between the show and my project. My regret is I feel like I could have had a lot less internal css if I used ids in this project. I also regret not adding as much customization to each page. Some of the css documents I think I could have merged into one. I also feel like I should have used more fonts that would contribute more to the themes of each page. I was thinking about adding bad ends where you get caught as an alien and you have to return from the start but ultimately I ran out of time. I'm fine with there not being any negative consequences for the alien, as you just get the experience of them trying new things and learning about human culture without any huge worries or issues. All in all this project was a very fun learning experience. I'm very glad I kept things funny and light hearted. The issue with making things serious is you have to keep it up all the way otherwise it feels disconcerting.
